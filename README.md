# linear-regression

Supervised machine learning attempting to calculate the best:

* theta0,theta1
* w,b
* slope, intercept

Whatever or however you learn it, and finding the optimal values using the cost function J.

This project takes linear number line, adds noise to that line of data, and uses linear regression (without using external libraries, purely calculations on my end from what I've learned) to compute the optimal values and finds out by computing the cost function based on the number of attempts that the user would like to do.

Please run: python main.py to start the project
